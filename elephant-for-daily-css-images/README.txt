A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/schooolman/pen/vgyQMV.

 For Day number 2 of the Daily CSS Images challenge, I made this elephant based around a logo I found on Dribble.

I think it turned out pretty good for a little night project.

I used a lot more absolute positioning then I would have liked to on this one, but with the shapes I was making it was a lot easier to deal with that way.

This probably doesn't scale well, and I'm not sure about cross browser.
